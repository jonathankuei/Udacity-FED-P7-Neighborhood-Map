## Project 7 - Neighborhood Map

The goal of this project was to create a single page application that would display interactive points of interest on a neighborhood map utilizing the `Google Maps API`. 
For my project, I created a Dog Park Locator detailing various popular dog runs located in New York City and incorporated the `Foursquare API` to showcase photographs taken by local park goers.
A filter function and list was also implemented which utilizes `Knockout MVVM` framework to dynamically update the UI as the user searches for a particular park.

### Getting Started

To use the Dog Park Locator, download the .zip files to your computer locally and run `index.html` inside your browser.
